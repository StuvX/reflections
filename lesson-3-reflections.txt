When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When collaborating or when working from different computers on the same project. Also as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because it would get messy if you are collaborating with people.
