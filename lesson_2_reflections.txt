What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git initialises the metadata tracking for the repository. It needs to be done to set up version tracking.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the files that are in the working directory that are yet to be added to the repository. It allows us to see which files are not being tracked, and only add in files that we want to track.
